      <p style="color: #919191"> Back-End Software Engineer / Student</p>
      <p>I work primarily with Python and C/C++ to do high-speed server side work. In my current position, I use Flask to operate a web server that allows
         users to interact with hardware that requires high-speed data processing (via C++.)</p>
      <p>My current position requires me to write extremely stable mission-critical software for the industrial sector. Given the speed requirements,
         the software allocates work to the GPU (using CUDA cores.)  I have 2 years of experience writing this sort of software.</p>
      <p>In the future, I will pursue a B.Sc in Computer Science, and hopefully will continue into graduate school with the goal of eventually doing research in the private sector. </p>
      <p>In the near future, I plan on learning Go(lang) as it combines the speed requirements of the software that I write along with the ease of development I enjoy with Python.</p>
      <p>If you wish to contact me, I think it should first be noted that I am a secondary school student. If you still wish to contact me, then click the (at) symbol next to my name.</p>
