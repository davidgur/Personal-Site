    Hello! This is my personal website.

    You can consider this website my elevator pitch, and as such this website took inspiration from the design of an elevator:
    - Boring
    - Grey
    TODO: Add elevator music

            <p style="color: #928374"> Software Engineer / Student</p>

            <p>
            I work primarily with Python and C++ to do data-intensive high performance compute work. I was recently admitted to the University of Waterloo, where I will be studying Computer Science.
            </p>

            <p>
            I recently worked as a research assistant at the York University mathematics and statistics department.
            I worked on developing an <a href="https://github.com/davidgur/AgentBasedModel">agent based modelling system</a> for epidemiological simulations involving small, complex populations. At this position, I worked with C++, Python, and MATLAB.
            </p>

            <p>
            I currently work at Research in Flows, where I work on research, architecture, and development of a fully digital cross correlation fluid flow measurement utility. This is designed as a low-cost, more accurate alternative to analog solutions in the industry. I worked with Python, C++, and MATLAB to implement a parallelized, high speed data processing solution.
