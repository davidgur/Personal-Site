  Hello! This is my personal website.

  You can consider this website my elevator pitch, and as such this website took inspiration from the design of an elevator:

    <p style="color: #919191"> Software Engineer / Student</p>

    <p>
      I work primarily with Python and C++ to do data-intensive high performance compute work. Recently, I implemented a web app that allowed users to remotely control signal generation and data acquisition hardware, and then process that data in (soft) real-time.
    </p>

    <p>
      Currently, I'm doing a co-op placement at the York University mathematics and statistics department where I'm working on a report that outlines an agent-based modelling system for epidemiological simulations. I wrote the model in C++. Source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/davidgur/AgentBasedModel">github</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In my most recent position, I worked on a product that aimed to make ultrasonic fluid flow measurement accessible to the average consumer. 
      This market has been for the most part populated by large industrial solutions, and we aimed to change that and make it available
      in a cheaper and smaller form-factor device. Sourc code is on <a href="https://github.com/davidgur/Frequency-Generator-Reader">github</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the near future, I want to work on my mathematical skills, and potentially learn some ML/AI.

      If you wish to contact me, I think it should first be noted that I am a secondary school student.
